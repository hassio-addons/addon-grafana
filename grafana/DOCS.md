# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Grafana

The analytics platform for all your metrics.

Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics
no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards. Learn
about your Home Automation system using sexy and compelling graphs, and other
data visualizations.

Combine this add-on with the InfluxDB add-on to get insanely powerful
insights to your home.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "Grafana" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store.
1. Install the "Grafana" add-on.
1. Start the "Grafana" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Grafana" to see if everything went well.
1. Open the Web UI.

**Note**: As the addon now supports both Ingress and direct access, the default
`admin` user has a password of `hassio`. **Due to the implementation the
password cannot be changed, however you can delete and create a new user, if so
please ensure to update the `grafana_ingress_user` option.**

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
grafana_ingress_user: frenck
plugins:
  - ayoungprogrammer-finance-datasource
  - grafana-clock-panel
env_vars:
  - name: GF_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_NAME
    value: Hassio
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `grafana_ingress_user`

When using Ingress grafana will automatically log in by default with a username
of `admin`. If a different user is required this option can be set.

### Option: `plugins`

Allows you to specify additional Grafana plugins to be installed to your
Grafana setup. For a list of available plugins, see:

<https://grafana.com/plugins>

**Note**: _Adding plugins will result in a longer start-up for the add-on._

### Option: `env_vars`

This option allows you to tweak every aspect of Grafana by setting
configuration options using environment variables. See the example at the
start of this chapter to get an idea of how the configuration looks.

For more information about using these variables, see the official Grafana
documentation:

<http://docs.grafana.org/installation/configuration/#using-environment-variables>

**Note**: _Only environment variables starting with `GF_` are accepted.\_

## Using it with the InfluxDB Community add-on

Grafana does not come out of the box pre-configured, but letting it interact
with the community [InfluxDB add-on][influxdb-addon] is pretty easy. Please,
follow the instructions from the on how to [create a database][create-db]
for Home Assistant.

1. Create a new user for Grafana on InfluxDB
   (InfluxDB Admin -> Users and "+ Create User")
1. Login into Grafana
1. Create a new datasource:

- Name: Anything you want, e.g., Home Assistant
- Type: InfluxDB
- HTTP > URL: `http://a0d7b954-influxdb:8086`
- HTTP > Access: Server (Default)
- Auth: (leave them all disabled)
- InfluxDB Details > Database: _Your Home Assistant InfluxDB database_,
  e.g., `homeassistant`
- InfluxDB Details > User: _Grafana InfluxDB username defined in step 1_
- InfluxDB Details > Password: _Grafana InfluxDB user password defined_
  _in step 1_

1. Hit Save & Test

## Anonymous Access

Anonymous access on a local network is possible by exposing the port in the
add-on configuration, along with setting the following environment variables:

```yaml
env_vars:
  - name: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED
    value: "true"
  - name: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_NAME
    value: "Main Org."
  - name: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE
    value: "Viewer"
```

It is not possible to enable anonymous or non-administrator access with Home
Assistant Cloud. This includes embedding Grafana resources with an iframe or
rendered image inside of a dashboard. For more details see
[Anonymous login not working, Grafana add-on 3.0.0 #55](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-grafana/issues/55).

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on does support ARM-based devices, nevertheless, they must
  at least be an ARMv7 device. (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is not supported).
- `To render a panel image, you must install the Grafana Image Renderer plugin.`
  This message is shown on ARM devices, like a Raspberry Pi. The Grafana Image
  Renderer plugin is not available for these devices.
