The open platform for beautiful analytics and monitoring.

![Grafana in the Home Assistant Frontend](images/screenshot.png)

## About

The analytics platform for all your metrics.

Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics
no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards. Learn
about your Home Automation system using sexy and compelling graphs, and other
data visualizations.

Combine this add-on with the InfluxDB add-on to get insanely powerful
insights to your home.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Grafana" add-on.
1. Start the "Grafana" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Grafana" to see if everything went well.
1. Open the Web UI and log in with: admin / hassio.
   Be sure to change the logins, once logged in.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "ssl": true,
  "certfile": "fullchain.pem",
  "keyfile": "privkey.pem",
  "plugins": [
    "ayoungprogrammer-finance-datasource",
    "grafana-clock-panel"
  ],
  "env_vars": [
    {
      "name": "GF_DEFAULT_INSTANCE_NAME",
      "value": "Hassio"
    },
    {
      "name": "GF_ALLOW_SIGN_UP",
      "value": "true"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface.
Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Hass.io_

### Option: `plugins`

Allows you to specify additional Grafana plugins to be installed to your
Grafana setup. For a list of available plugins, see:

<https://grafana.com/plugins>

**Note**: _Adding plugins will result in a longer start-up for the add-on._

### Option: `env_vars`

This option allows you to tweak every aspect of Grafana by setting
configuration options using environment variables. See the example at the
start of this chapter to get an idea of how the configuration looks.

For more information about using these variables, see the official Grafana
documentation:

<http://docs.grafana.org/installation/configuration/#using-environment-variables>

**Note**: _Only environment variables starting with `GF_` are accepted._

## Using it with the InfluxDB Community add-on

Grafana does not come out of the box pre-configured, but letting it interact
with the community [InfluxDB add-on][influxdb-addon] is pretty easy. Please,
follow the instructions from the on how to [create a database][create-db]
for Home Assistant.

- Create a new user for Grafana on InfluxDB
  (InfluxDB Admin -> Users and "+ Create User")
- Login into Grafana
- Create a new datasource:
  - Name: Anything you want, e.g., Home Assistant
  - Type: InfluxDB
  - HTTP > URL: `http://a0d7b954-influxdb:8086`
  - HTTP > Access: Server (Default)
  - Auth: (leave them all disabled)
  - InfluxDB Details > Database: _Your Home Assistant InfluxDB database_
    e.g., `homeassistant`
  - InfluxDB Details > User: _InfluxDB username_
  - InfluxDB Details > Password: _InfluxDB user password_
- Hit Save & Test

Done!

## Embedding into Home Assistant

It is possible to embed the Grafana interface directly into Home Assistant,
allowing you to access it through the Home Assistant frontend.

Home Assistant provides the `panel_iframe` component, for these purposes.

Example configuration:

```yaml
panel_iframe:
  grafana:
    title: Grafana
    icon: mdi:chart-timeline
    url: http://addres.to.your.hass.io:3000
```

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on does support ARM-based devices, nevertheless, they must
  at least be an ARMv7 device. (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is not supported).

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:
